## Proyect Overview
This project focuses on leveraging the power of OpenAI's advanced language model within the Unity game engine to create dynamic and interactive Non-Player Characters (NPCs). The primary objective is to enhance the realism and engagement of NPCs by enabling them to understand and respond to player inputs in a natural and contextually appropriate manner.

### How to use\

YOU WILL NEED AN API KEY!

The game starts in the Main Menu scene. Here, the player is presented with a simple interface featuring a "Play" button. Clicking this button transitions the player to the main level.
In the main level, players can interact with NPCs using a chat input field. The player types their message, and upon submission, the NPC's response is displayed in a dialogue bubble above the NPC. This setup allows for real-time text-based interaction, making the NPCs feel responsive and engaged with the player's input.
